## How to use it?

Well, this repo is probably cloned to our server... it should be located at `/server/script' folder, but if you donÂ´t find it in our server, please follow up our [Script Instalation Wiki](../wikis/Initial-Setup).

## Roadmap

## 1. Clone scripts

_Clone scripts_ will allow you to duplicate ("clone") a running site (the whole environment) to a new domain, with all files cloned exact the same way you had in the _original_ site.

[Link to documentation](./clone/README.md)

## 2. Backup scripts

The _backup scripts_ was designed to run a complete **backup**, **restore** and backup **cleanup**. Please check each feature in details in our [Wiki](../wikis/scripts/backup)

## 3. Plugin WP script

This script is meant to install plugins in a running Wordpress.

[Link to documentation](./plugin-install-wp/README.md)

## 4. Start new WP script
